## About
Going through the landscape at Virginia Tech can be very exhausting for new and
transfer students. To merge the differences between these gaps, we developed
Campus Chat, a comprehensive mobile application designed to create a supportive
and interactive platform for the community of our students. This app uses advanced
software systems to make sure that every student can find their niche through easy
communication and shared interests that are known without interaction with each
other from the beginning. Campus Chat offers profile creation features that allow
students to show their academic and extracurricular activities where they can better
connect with each other based on common interests. Additionally, users can be matched with 
other groups and people that our application finds overlap in interests. Both anonymous board
posts and private group chats are supported with this application.

Unlike other social media, Campus Chat specifically targets college campuses, providing a unique
and specialized media for students navigating this time.
